Demo Project: Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project serves mainly as an example for `<Pluralsight <http://www.pluralsight.com>`_ Python 3 Best Practices
course. It demonstrates how to structure a Python project.

The idea is to simulate a very simple role-playing game where two characters
fight. The game mechanics  are controlled by the :class:`Game.game` class and the
characters are :class:`gamedemo.player.Player` instances, each of which has a 
:class:`gamedemo.weapon.Weapon` instance that represents the weapon they use.

The scenario we will try to simulate is of an old-fashioned knight fighting a dragon.
